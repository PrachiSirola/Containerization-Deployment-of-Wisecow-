# Containerization--Deployment-of-Wisecow-
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the containerisation, deployment, and automation (CI/CD) of the Wisecow Application — a simple bash-based web server that displays random quotes using the fortune and cowsay commands.

The app is Dockerized, deployed on Kubernetes, and integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.


🎯 Objectives

✅ Containerize the Wisecow application using Docker
✅ Deploy it to a Kubernetes environment (Minikube / Kind / Killercoda)
✅ Automate the build & push process using GitHub Actions
✅ Enable secure & accessible service exposure (port-based access)
